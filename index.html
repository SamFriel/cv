        <p class="short-summary">My name is Samson Friel. For the last few years I've experimented with many different
            languages of programming.
            I started with C#, using .Net to do various things like making MVP websites.
            After this I gravitated towards Python, I'd heard so much about it, that I had to try it. I moved to
            Javascript lastly: which has been a blast.
            I studied using a Udemy course, a Bootcamp for web development made by the App Brewery with Angela Yu
            teaching it.
            Most of the time during the bootcamp is spent learning somewhat roundabout ways to do things, in order to
            learn how it operates better, before moving onto making things like:
            To do lists which operate with MongoDB
            Uploading a static website to Github
            Using bootstrap to recreate something akin to Tinder as practice.
            It was all incredibly fun, and I couldn't wait to learn more after the course was over, so I thrust myself
            into making a website for my DnD campign.
            Now, here I am. Opening up to freelance work and anything else that may spring up. If I could be of use to
