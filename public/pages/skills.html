        <h1 class="top-h1">Interested in what I do?</h1>
        <h2 class="text-centered">Javascript is my main skill, but there are others.</h2>
        <!-- <p class="short-summary">I started out using C#, which I had spent an absurd amount of time on. I did many unity
            classes from the Unity Site.
            I graduated to making my own text editor, specifically for writing DnD stories, but soon scrapped it as I
            didn't want to reinvent the wheel.
            After spending a lot of time with C#, I decided to learn ASP.NET, which became hard because the class I was
            taking WASN'T teaching how to use HTML CSS,
            instead it was teaching how to make that specific application. I searched Udemy in hopes of finding one
            that'd teach the skill. I decided upon learning Javascript and found a
            bootcamp capable of teaching me. The instructor seemed nice, and it was extensive. It taught me HTML5, CSS,
            Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, how to make
            node plugins, how to use Databases in code and in CLI. It had a giant section on react, but didn't explain
            the MERN thing so I do not know how to use it in conjunction with Node yet.
            Longstory short my skills include everything aforementioned, I am quick on the uptake, barely sleep, and
            able to work for a very long time while staying completely focused.
            Specifics below.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="short-summary">
            I can write code pertaining to making Indexes, I can code routes, I can make Schemas for MongoDB, I can
            query for SQL.
            Optimize code, use EJS templates, EJS to use Javascript within HTML, Can google, use stack overflow/reddit
            to find what I need if I don't know it.
            Can make classes, have a giant understanding of OOP, can style a website with CSS, build the bones with
            HTML, and use Bootstrap to make it look bearable.
            Make pure HTML sites with tiny amounts of javascript that reside on the website, or use Node to do the same
            but on a server.
            Will spend MY OWN time learning anything that is needed, and have nothing but a strong desire to be the best
            at what I do.

                I have done almost all my coding using Node and packages like Passport, express, and many others. React
                is something I have a decent amount of time on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bootstrap</b> <br>

                <b>MongoDB</b> <br>
                Can make indexes in code and CLI, can query, sort and return lists. Can easily execute any part of CRUD
                through code or CLI.

            <li>
                <b>Git/Github</b> <br>
                Can use both, but on my own projects have preferred only Git as it's much easier by myself.
            </li>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem; padding:2.5rem;">On my Github I have a project that I've worked on recently. It
